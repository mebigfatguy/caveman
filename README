A library containing standard collections using primitive types, including

List
Set
Map
Bag

Each collection type can be used with any primitive type, 

boolean
byte
char
short
int
long
float
double

There are interfaces defined for each primitive types, in the package

com.mebigfatguy.caveman

such as

IntList
CharSet
ByteBag

For Maps there are actually there kinds:

primitive->primitive
primitive->Object
Object->primitive

so, interfaces like

IntLongMap
CharMap<V>
ShortValueMap<K>

For each combination of primitive there are class implementations in the package

com.mebigfatguy.caveman.impl

These classes following the naming of the interface but are prefixed by CaveMan, so

IntList l = new CaveManIntList();
ByteSet s = new CaveManByteSet();
FloatBag b = new CaveManFloatBag();

and for maps,

IntDoubleMap m = new CaveManIntDoubleMap();
CharMap<Integer> m = new CharMap<Integer>();
DoubleValueMap<String> m = new DoubleValueMap<String>();

On top of the available interfaces, classes derive from a 'collection' class with a primitive name, such as

FloatCollection
